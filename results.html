<p>Read what students have to say about Kickstart Coding</p>

<h3>Nicolas Miller Antioch, California</h3>
<p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER @ ROOSTER GRIN MEDIA</p>
<p>“The custom paced structure was possibly the most vital component to my success [...] this setup allowed me to pace my progress and uphold my life's balance in the process.”</p>

<p>“It sounds cheesy, but Kickstart Coding gave me the opportunity to make a career shift that I never thought I would be able to. The personalized tutoring helped target my weaknesses and get honest feedback on my projects that large scale programs are unable to provide. The custom paced structure was possibly the most vital component to my success; I've never been the person who gets something new on the first, second, or even third try, but this setup allowed me to pace my progress and uphold my life's balance in the process. The instructional material was intense, but Michael makes some hilarious references and segments the topics into digestible lessons. If I could give any advice, I would say to not let anything stop you, but ESPECIALLY don't let you stop yourself. You 1000% can do this and self doubt or fear of difficulty are likely to be your biggest obstacles -- you just have to be kind to yourself and get up again when JavaScript and CSS inevitably knock you down. You are going to be so proud of yourself because this is massive and this is worth it!”</p>


<h3>Anthony Sifontes New Orleans, Louisiana</h3>
<p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER @ AMINO</p>
<p>“I eventually received an offer to be a Software Engineer at an exciting healthcare start-up, and only 11 weeks into the program.”</p>

<p>“My career thus far had been in data analytics. I wanted to transition to a developer role and ultimately be able to create and turn my ideas into reality. I had not taken any coding courses before this, only online tutorials and books, so I was not sure what to expect. Class after class, I was blown away by the passion Michael and his team brought to each and every lesson! The classes were lively, balanced between lecture, demonstrations, guided coding activities, and group work, while still being accessible to a wide range of experience levels.</p>

<p>A couple of months into the course, I started applying for developer positions, and soon I was excited to be invited for a round of on-site interviews. Michael was very supportive, coaching me on how to best present my work experience, and guiding me through a mock "whiteboard" interview. Every interview was more challenging than the last, but all of the coaching and prep received at Kickstart beforehand was critical to my moving forward in the process. You can imagine my excitement when I eventually received an offer to be a Software Engineer at an exciting healthcare start-up, and only 11 weeks into the program! Now, I've been at my new position for several months, and I love it. The work we did in class was instrumental in preparing me for my new day-to-day duties. I'm very thankful to the Kickstart Coding team and the help they provided in transitioning to my new software engineering career.”</p>


<h3>Andrew Thorton Alameda, California</h3>
<p>DATA ENGINEER @ LYFT</p>
<p>“Using my newly acquired skills, I got a great new job as a Data Engineer just a couple of weeks after finishing the Kickstart Coding course.”</p>

<p>“After spending years as a software project and product manager flirting with the idea of becoming a software engineer, I finally got up the courage to sign up for a coding bootcamp. I looked at many different options and chose Kickstart Coding because it provides excellent value and is staffed by people that are clearly passionate about teaching technology. I enjoyed the in-class lessons which are an engaging mix of lecture, live-coding walkthroughs, and activities. The homework assignments and group projects built nicely on the stuff we learned in class and helped to reinforce the concepts with very practical examples. The curriculum does a masterful job of challenging people with some coding experience while also being accessible to people with no coding background at all. While the vast majority of the curriculum is very focused on teaching specific languages and frameworks, the last couple lessons of the Front-End portion of the course are focused on some more general concepts that were extremely helpful in preparing me for interviews. Using my newly acquired skills, I got a great new job as a Data Engineer just a couple of weeks after finishing the Kickstart Coding course. I would recommend Kickstart Coding to everyone, even if you don't want a job as a software engineer. Learning to code in this setting was really fun!”</p>


<h3>Sarah Farnsworth-Kumli San Francisco, California</h3>
<p>SOLUTIONS ENGINEER @ OKTA</p>
<p>“I walked into Kickstart Coding to brush up on my skills. I left with a new career.”</p>

<p>“Now that I am on the other side, have landed a job, and am now working with developers I can honestly say that Kickstart is a quality program. They take a modern approach to teaching and teach what's current in an adapting industry (also what stacks companies are hiring for!).</p>

<p>Michael covered CS concepts in an incredibly accessible way for a diverse classroom with different levels of experience. The course material was the perfect balance of providing introductory guidance and challenge. Group projects exposed us to the challenges of working in a development team and we continued to build on new iterations of our personal projects.</p>

<p>It's a privilege to have been a part of such a fantastic community, and I'm excited to see it grow. Amazing how such a short time can change your life, if you're considering taking the plunge, DO IT!”</p>


<h3>Nicol Hawkins San Franciso, California</h3>
<p>PLATFORM SPECIALIST @ AMPLITUDE</p>
<p>“Thanks to the skills I learned at Kickstart Coding, I was able to market myself for entry-level positions in the tech industry.”</p>

<p>“When I started Kickstart Coding, I had very few programming skills and no prior work experience in tech. It was a huge leap for me and it literally changed my life! Kickstart Coding is more affordable than most coding bootcamps and the curriculum is top-notch while having a lot of repeat value.</p>

<p>I left the course with a personal webpage full of projects to showcase and revisited the curriculum often to tackle bonus activities. The course is approachable whether you're like me and just starting out or already possess programming skills. I am blown away by how much I learned since my first day at Kickstart Coding; from my first HTML file all the way to navigating complex frameworks and implementing APIs.</p>

<p>This program not only gave me the technical skills required for a career in tech -- it helped me recognize the potential and capacity I have for learning. A major part of my new role as a Platform Specialist is communicating with engineers and data analysts, so having a background in software helps me communicate effectively and efficiently. Thanks to the skills I learned at Kickstart Coding, I was able to market myself for entry-level positions in the tech industry.”</p>


<h3>Yulia Tuzov San Mateo, California</h3>
<p>QA ENGINEER @ SKUPOS</p>
<p>“Kickstart’s curriculum gave me technical understanding of all the moving parts involved in building a software product.”</p>

<p>“I have been in tech for couple of years in a QA role prior to going to this bootcamp. And now transitioning into an engineering role. Kickstart’s curriculum gave me technical understanding of all the moving parts involved in building a software product as well as practice of building those parts in group projects and individual projects which is extremely valuable experience.</p>

<p>The curriculum overall is very well structured in a way that after every topic is introduced students had to apply it in their homework right away as well as final projects at the end of each course. Program also includes industry insights and job prep material. Michael, Mark and Maddy are very passionate about their students to succeed in the career transitions. You do have to work a lot during the course, so be ready, but you’ll also have amazing support. Support also doesn’t end after the course, you can come to their hack &amp; learns to get help or guidance.”</p>


<h3>Kyle Pollock San Francisco, California</h3>
<p>KNOWLEDGE BASE MANAGER @ SYNAPSE</p>
<p>“I got a job offer within 30 days of completing my 4 month summer cohort.”</p>

<p>“I was looking for a place to learn Python, JavaScript, and how to work with APIs to increase my skills, and make myself more marketable as a former jack of all trades website manager. I was quite familiar with the coding bootcamps in the Bay Area, as a friend of mine helped start one in San Francisco. When I searched around for programs and found Kickstart Coding, I couldn't find one that could beat it's overall value through affordability, flexibility, and course offerings. I was able to build three strong projects in Github (along with other projects) and an online portfolio. I got a job offer within 30 days of completing my 4 month summer cohort. I also more than tripled my income from my previous job as a non-profit communications manager. I am grateful to have gone through Kickstart Coding, and for the ongoing support beyond graduation through the teachers and alumni group.”</p>


<h3>Rudy Trubitt Oakland, California</h3>
<p>SENIOR SOFTWARE TEST ENGINEER @ DOLBY</p>
<p>“Kickstart Coding gave me the key skills I needed to advance my career.”</p>

<p>“I needed a career boost and Kickstart delivered. From the start, I was impressed by my interactions with the program’s staff. Although I was looking specifically for Python instruction, the additional material in the back-end course turned out to be extremely relevant. The class work was challenging but well-differentiated for students with varying levels of programming experience. And I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know and work with everyone in my cohort.</p>

<p>During my job hunting and interviewing, I regularly reflected on things I learned in the program. There were times when I literally could hear Michael's voice in my head while I answered interview questions. Although my previous skills also helped me land my current position, there's no doubt that Kickstart Coding gave me the key skills I needed to advance my career.”</p>


<h3>Errin Mixon Oakland, California</h3>
<p>JUNIOR FRONTEND DEVELOPER @ GEOEX</p>
<p>“I couldn't have afforded the time or money to take a traditional bootcamp. I came out the other end as a web developer – with a new job.”</p>

<p>“I come from a zero-tech background. I wanted to build an app. Michael said he could teach me that, so I signed up.</p>

<p>I'm not going to lie. This bootcamp was hard. For a tech newbie with a full-time job and family, the time commitment is intense. I was often frustrated. I cried, a lot. I secretly thought that I shouldn't have been admitted to the course.</p>

<p>But I came out the other end as a web developer – with a new job. That hadn't even been my goal, and you couldn't find anybody more surprised than me!</p>

<p>I couldn't have afforded the time or money to take a traditional bootcamp. I never would have tried. Kickstart Coding made it possible for me to learn these skills, and it's no exaggeration to say that it changed the trajectory of my career, and possibly my life. Michael is an excellent and engaging teacher, as are TA's Maddy and Mark, and I owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>5 stars for Kickstart – well worth your money.”</p>


<h3>Jeremy Johnson Madison, Wisconsin</h3>
<p>WEB DEVELOPER @ KNOW HOW</p>
<p>“The skills I learned in this course I use every day at my new job as a web developer.”</p>

<p>“Out of high school I got a 2 year web programming degree at a local technical college. I applied and applied for programming jobs and was unable to land one. I really enjoyed programming but started to think I would never be able to make it my career. A few years went by working odd jobs when I got the opportunity to take this bootcamp online.</p>

<p>I can't begin to say how great this course is. I learned more about programming in a matter of weeks than I did in a matter of years in school. Seeing real world examples of what we were learning along the way made me excited to learn and do the work. In addition to the amazing coursework, Micheal equips you with great tools to help you find a job. I was able to get a programming job just weeks after completing the course. The skills I learned in this course I use every day at my job as a web developer.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my new job and 100% recommend this course to anyone looking to get into tech!”</p>
