            opportunity to make a career shift that I never thought I would be

            possibly the most vital component to my success; I've never been

            intense, but Michael makes some hilarious references and segments
            the topics into digestible lessons. If I could give any advice, I
            would say to not let anything stop you, but ESPECIALLY don't let
            you stop yourself. You 1000% can do this and self doubt or fear of
            difficulty are likely to be your biggest obstacles -- you just have
            to be kind to yourself and get up again when JavaScript and CSS

            transition to a developer role and ultimately be able to create and
            turn my ideas into reality. I had not taken any coding courses
            before this, only online tutorials and books, so I was not sure

            demonstrations, guided coding activities, and group work, while
            still being accessible to a wide range of experience levels.

            A couple of months into the course, I started applying for
            developer positions, and soon I was excited to be invited for a
            round of on-site interviews. <strong>Michael was very supportive,
            coaching me on how to best present my work experience, and guiding
            me through a mock "whiteboard" interview.</strong> Every interview
            was more challenging than the last, but all of the coaching and
            prep received at Kickstart beforehand was critical to my moving
            forward in the process. You can imagine my excitement when I
            eventually received an offer to be a Software Engineer at an
            exciting healthcare start-up, and only 11 weeks into the program!
            Now, I've been at my new position for several months, and I love
            it.  The work we did in class was instrumental in preparing me for
            my new day-to-day duties.  I'm very thankful to the Kickstart

            After spending years as a software project and product manager flirting
            with the idea of becoming a software engineer, I finally got up the
            courage to sign up for a coding bootcamp. I looked at many different
            options and chose Kickstart Coding because it provides excellent value
            and is staffed by people that are clearly passionate about teaching
            technology. I enjoyed the in-class lessons which are an engaging mix of
            lecture, live-coding walkthroughs, and activities. The homework
            assignments and group projects built nicely on the stuff we learned in
            class and helped to reinforce the concepts with very practical
            examples. <strong>The curriculum does a masterful job of challenging
            people with some coding experience while also being accessible to
            people with no coding background at all.</strong> While the vast
            majority of the curriculum is very focused on teaching specific
            languages and frameworks, the last couple lessons of the Front-End
            portion of the course are focused on some more general concepts that
            were extremely helpful in preparing me for interviews. Using my newly
            acquired skills, I got a great new job as a Data Engineer just a couple
            of weeks after finishing the Kickstart Coding course. <strong>I would
