    This is the common "header" across all the pages on this site. Define more
    components here to have them be available with an "x-" prefix, or create
    new libraries and include them in file with <Library -src=...></Library>
    type syntax.

    To get you started, we import the "layout" library, and load it with an
    "x-" prefix.
